# WaTaCook
This repository contains the code for WaTaCook. <br/> Not sure WaTaCook (what to cook)? Using this app will have people screaming WaTaCook (What a cook)*! WaTaCook is an app that helps reduce food waste by suggesting recipes for users to cook based on what is in their fridge. 

## Introduction
This app is created in Java using **Firebase (db and auth)**, **Glide**, **Volley** and the **Spoonacular api**. It is created without using any kind of architectural pattern.

## Thoughts
This is the first proper app I created that I released onto Google Play. 
As it was written without any knowledge of architectural patterns, or much knowledge in general, the code can be difficult to understand and has cases where the app may crash. 
It is kept in the current state as a reminder of where I started my journey as an app developer. 
The difference in code readability in the subsequent project can be seen [here](https://github.com/220284hk/YNews)
